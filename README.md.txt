In Silico Discovery of NDM-1 Metallo-β-Lactamase Inhibitors for Klebsiella pneumoniae

Overview
Antibiotic resistance poses a significant global health threat, and the emergence of New Delhi Metallo-β-Lactamase (NDM-1) in Klebsiella pneumoniae has rendered many β-lactam antibiotics ineffective. This project aims to identify potential inhibitors of NDM-1 using computational approaches, including molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Project Objectives
- Retrieve and prepare the NDM-1 target protein.
- Screen standard ligands and sulfonamide derivatives for potential inhibitory activity.
- Conduct molecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina.
- Perform ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) predictions.
- Carry out molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to assess complex stability.

Methodology
1. Retrieval of Target Protein and Ligands
- Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: `6NY7`) was used to retrieve the NDM-1 protein.
- Standard ligands (Penicillin, Benzyl Penicillin, Mercaptopurine, Ampicillin, Sulfonamide, etc.) were retrieved from the *PubChem* database.
- Sulfonamide derivatives (~1400 molecules) were filtered using Lipinski’s and Veber’s rules.

2. Molecular Docking
- Protein preparation and docking studies were conducted using AutoDock Vina in PyRx.
- Sulfonamide showed promising inhibitory activity against NDM-1.
- Virtual screening of ~1400 sulfonamide derivatives led to the identification of 60 top hits.

3. ADMET Studies
- ADMET properties were analyzed using ADMETLab 2.0 and Protox-II.
- Two promising candidates were identified:
  - (3Z)-N-hydroxypenta-1,3-diene-2-sulfonamide (PubChem CID: 118156306)
  - N-hydroxyfuran-2-sulfonamide (PubChem CID: 46175386)

4. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
- Conducted for 100 ns using *GROMACS 5.0.4*.
- RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA plots confirmed the stability of the identified complexes.

Results
- Docking Studies:Sulfonamide derivatives demonstrated strong binding affinity.
- Virtual Screening: A dataset of about 4500 sulfonamide compounds were screened against NDM-1
- ADMET Analysis: Two lead compounds exhibited favorable pharmacokinetics and minimal toxicity.
- MD Simulations: The selected compounds formed stable interactions with NDM-1.

Conclusion
This study identified (3Z)-N-hydroxypenta-1,3-diene-2-sulfonamide and N-hydroxyfuran-2-sulfonamide as potential NDM-1 inhibitors. Further experimental validation and lead optimization are necessary for drug development.
